# Bad_Leg
Reigniting my learnig, I took TheOdinProject course and this repo contains practice files for my learning journey. After such a long time not coding I feel this will give me the headstart  I need to get my hands dirty in the JS world. As i go through this journey, I hope you take a bit of your precious time to view my code and do well to say something! 
So excited about this...
See you in the codes!
